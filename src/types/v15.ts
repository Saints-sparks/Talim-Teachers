/**
 * Hand-written types for the v1.5 routes this app calls.
 *
 * Source: `talimBE-V2/docs/v1.5-platform-sync.md` (contract of 2026-10-06),
 * §1 Tickets (the requester routes) and §3 Version. The backend is being
 * built in parallel, so these are NOT yet in the generated `api.d.ts`.
 * The shapes match Talim Admin's `src/types/v15.ts` field for field.
 *
 * When `talimBE-V2/docs/api-types.d.ts` carries `/tickets/*`, run
 * `npm run types:api` and replace each type below with its generated
 * equivalent, then delete this file.
 *
 * Fields tagged `NOT IN CONTRACT` are ones the screens need that the
 * contract does not define yet; the screens degrade gracefully without them.
